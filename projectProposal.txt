Project Proposal

Make a plinko with matter.js
  Each node in the plinko plays audio when hit. (tone.js)
  Dropping a ball down the plinko creates a melody.

Train Wekinator to remember which nodes are hit in the plinko.
  Choose 1 of 6 starting points from which to drop the plinko.
  Train Wekinator (intentionally poorly) on outcomes of starting points.
  Wekinator estimates a melody based on its training, with specific effects presets.
  The differences in estimated and actual melodies control the timbre of nodes,
    much like interpolating between presets.
    // If it starts on a path similar to drop point 1, certain effects are initiated,
    // but if the path changes to something similar to drop point 4, Wekinator interpolates values.

Then just drop a ton of balls in the plinko and try to break Wekinator.
  I could program a specific set of ball drops to create a "performable" piece of music.

Tools:

  -matter.js
  -node.js (?)
  -tone.js
web sockets (?)
